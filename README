John the Ripper formatting automation script

This script was written as means to automate the formatting process within John the Ripper. John boasts an impressive number of 
formatting options available to the user, however, an issue with this is if the user is attempting to break a large number of hashes
with multiple format types within the same (or multiple files) John may not be able to run without specifiying the --format-<format type>
option. Leaving users to have to go back and manually run the program wasting valuble time and resources. This script allows the user
to run John the Ripper without having to manually run these various formats against a single or even multiple files. The script has also
been modified to give the user the ability to input a custom wordlist (or multiple wordlists), use the default John wordlist, or even just 
use the industry standard rockyou.txt wordlist. However the rockyou.txt must be located within the /usr/share/wordlists directory. In 
the future I will modify the script so that it will search the system for the rockyou.txt wordlist and if not found download it to give 
the user more plug and play versatility. Additionally more functionality has been given the script allowing the user to increase the fork
of John, however at this time I have not added checks to that functionality so it is up to the user to know what the maximum for is their 
system in capable of. This is another item that I will add to the running TODO list and eventually modify. One key aspect that I did be
sure to add to this program is the ability to use *nix style globbing. I detest having to type out complex named directories or files, and
like many I'll often mistype these complex names, simply adding globbing was a way for me to keep some of my own sanity when typing out
long and complex directory/file names.

        TODO:
-CORRECT 'Error with format dynamic_n: Unknown ciphertext format name requested', possibly an issue with john itself. I guess
    I'll work on correcting this when I need to use the dynamic_n format. 
-ADD try/except block to prevent the user from mistyping something and having to reset the script. 
    mostly just need to add this because I mistype stuff all the time and hate having to retype extra stuff.
-ADD greater functionality at the initial file input, as it stands the user can easily mistype and screw up the 
    input causing them to have to redo the entire thing.
-RECONFIGURE print statements, as they stand they're easy to read but something about their presentation just throws me off.
-OPTIMIZE how the script runs against the format types, even now just running 2 hash files with only a few hashes each and
    a custom wordlist that is very small it takes forever a day to run through all the format types simply because I don't need
    all the format types every time. Potentially need to call another program first, or develop something in python to ID the
    hashes in the file and pass that along to main so it selects only the required format types.
-ADD more wordlists to the wordlist selection tab, this will require me to package these custom wordlists with the script, 
    for right now its assumed that the user will have the rockyou.txt wordlist already on their system in the /usr/share/wordlists
    directory.
-ADD checks to the --fork-<fork option> feature to keep the user from creating errors by using a fork their system is incapable of running
